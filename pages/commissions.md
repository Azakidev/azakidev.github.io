## Terms of Service

<div class="wrap">

<div class="card">

# How many characters?

The price is calculated per character drawn.<br>
For example, in a two character commission with two variations to have one of the characters swapped by someone else, you'd be charged three characters total instead of four.

This also applies to YCHs, where usually some of my characters may already be drawn and therefore cheaper if you choose one of them.

<div class="card">

# Changed your mind?
  
Full refunds are guaranteed up to the first few drafts or sketches.<br>
I may also change my mind or deny a commission at any point, however refunds are not guaranteed in the latter stages of a commission.

I may also deny taking a commission if it contains a copyrighted character you don't own or a topic I may not be comfortable with, but feel free to ask!

<div class="card">

# Sharing is caring

Please credit me whenever you share my art.<br>
It also helps a lot when you do share it!<br>
This applies to non commissioned art as well.<br>
It's just good manners.

Due to Twitter's actions, please crop or otherwise obscure or distort part of the art before sharing in that platform.

Do **not** crop out or otherwise remove my signature as you'd be banned from ever commissioning me again.

## What's the process?

<div class="wrap">

<div class="card">

# First...

Contact me through your platform of choice to be added to my wait-list.<br>
The process is free and without any compromise.<br>
You can consult the wait-list at any time, even if you're not going to buy one.

</div>
<div class="card">

# Then...

You'll be contacted back once your turn arrives, the details of the commission will be discussed and full payment will be done.<br>
I will start then working on it, giving frequent updates on every step of the way.

</div>
<div class="card">

# Finally!

The commission is finished and you may share it!
