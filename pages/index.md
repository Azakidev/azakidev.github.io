# The dolfare

The dolfare, or dawlfs.

They are my custom species to which I'm developing a cohesive world, culture, and history for.
            
Free to make and open source, they're open for collaboration, ideas, and participation by making one!

# NS0X

It's the story for one of my characters, Nasu.

He started off as a joke character, but since then he's morphed into a character with a rather tragic story.

NS0X is the story of his creation and the people who made his existence possible, told in the form of journal logs.

# Tales of Laraybis

The collection of my character's stories.

The full story of my main characters, Kurae and Nathaki, told in the form of three independent chapters.

It's certainly one of my most incomplete projects, as it is also the largest as well as the one I want to dedicate the most time to.

# Heart of Sea

A short story in the world of Laraybis.

Heart of Sea is a short tale following an unnamed outsider to Laraybis in a vacation trip which quickly turned into a spiritual one.<br>

Despite happening long after the main story, it exposes some world-building and context for the series in a self contained way.

# This website

The hub for all my work.

I once started this website as a one-off experiment as a quick form to share my socials, since then it's become a little corner on the internet for myself.

My plans for this site is to continue expanding it with more information about what I do and make sure anyone interested in my work can find everywhere I go.

# Plantilla

A tool for cropping and applying templates to images.

I made this tool to learn how to use technologies such as electron, as well as to speed up making posts for my social media.
